LOW-POLY FOREST SURVIVAL STARTER PACK LITE 

October 2025 Version 1.1 update:
- Added a hatchet tool prop
- Optimized all models reducing the poly count


Pack Props:
- Campfire
- Pickaxe
- Hatchet
- Torch

Unique Models: 4

Textures: 1 BaseColor (Albedo) Texture shared between all models

Pivot:
Be sure to have the top left box in the viewport set to PIVOT not Center.
This will ensure the Prop rotates from the correct Pivot point!

Thank you for downloading the Low-Poly Forest Survival Starter Pack Lite! The Assets can be dragged and dropped from the prefabs folder. The Campfire, Pickaxe, and Torch share one material (ForestSurvival_Mat).
